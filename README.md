# Why the heck does this exist?
I needed something to actually grab the contents of a git commit, not just the commit message.
I couldn't find anything that did this, so I made it myself.

# How to use this
Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the values.
run `npm i` to install the dependencies,
then run `node .` or `npm run start` to run the script.
